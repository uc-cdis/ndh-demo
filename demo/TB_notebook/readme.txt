Steps to run mounted notebook in NIAID Data Ecosystem.

1. Login in https://niaiddata.org/ using you user id and password.

2. Navigate to the enviroment that you will run the notebook (eg: https://aids.niaiddata.org/) and login.

3. Navigate to Profile and click Create API key. Then click Download json to save the credential.json file locally.

4. Navigate to Workspace, select the mounted notebook you would like to run.

5. Upload your credential.json file under /home/jovyan/pd.

6. Double click to open the notebook. From the navigation bar on the top left, click Run and then select Run All Cells to execute the notebook.


Jupyter Notebook- TB Ariba and Mykrobe (Lab Edition) overview:

Under tb-notebook folder, there are "nde_tb_pynb.ipynb" python notebook and its dependent library "nde_tb_function.py", and "nde_tb_rnb.ipynb" R notebook and its dependent library "nde_tb_function.r". "out.summary.csv" is generated from running Ariba software for ~6000 tuberculosis isolate's sequencing files.  "match_plot_sort_mykrobe.txt" is generated by comparing the drug resistance phenotype predicted by Ariba or Mykrobe with the tested phenotype. "nde_tb_rnb.ipynb" used "out.summary.csv" and "match_plot_sort_mykrobe.txt" as input files for visualization to compare the prediction accuracy of Ariba and Mykrobe software.

"nde_tb_pynb.ipynb" query structure data and download object file from niaid data ecosystem TB enviroment, and perform data analysis on data from TB-PATRIC project. The notebook run Ariba and Mykrobe software on tuberculosis raw sequencing files and extract the drug resistance phenotype predicted by the softwares. The prediction result will be submitted to TB-PATRIC project in sequencing result node.

"nde_tb_rnb.ipynb" visualized the specificity and sensitivity of predicting the resistance to four first line drugs by Ariba and Mykrobe softwares. It also compares the prediction accuracy between Ariba and Mykrobe softwares.
